Most of my code is in [my personal GitHub repository](https://github.com/tholden). This includes:




    
  * My [dynareOBC toolkit](https://github.com/tholden/OBCToolkit)

    
  * My [dynare transformation engine](https://github.com/tholden/DynareTransformationEngine)

    
  * My [alternative preprocessor for removing model local variables](https://github.com/tholden/DynareRemoveLocalVariables)



Additionally, the links below are to old code which may still be of some use:
  





    
  * [Code for performing log-linearisation in Matlab with the Symbolic Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31693).

    
  * [Code for performing log-linearisation in Maple](http://code.google.com/p/maple-log-linearisation/).

    
  * [C# code to trim any redundant model local variables from a macro-expanded Dynare MOD file](https://sites.google.com/a/tholden.org/root/files/DynareTrimRedundantLocalVariables.cs?attredirects=0). (Created as a bug work-around.)

    
  * [C# code to extract a list of equations from a macro-expanded Dynare MOD file](https://sites.google.com/a/tholden.org/root/files/DynareGetEquations.cs?attredirects=0).

    
  * [Basic first order, single bound, inequality constraint code](http://www.dynare.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3104#p8087)
