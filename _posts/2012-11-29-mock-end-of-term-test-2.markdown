Below is the mock for the end of term test which will happen next week (week 10). As I said in the lecture, the final test will be identical except for different parameter values. It is supposed to go a bit beyond what we've covered in lectures, so don't be scared if it seems confusing at first. Just take your time, and work through it carefully over the next week.
