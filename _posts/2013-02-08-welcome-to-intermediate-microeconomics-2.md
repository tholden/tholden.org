Welcome to the course website. Here I'll upload all of the slides, and all of the problem sets. (Answers to problem sets will be distributed in classes.)  
  
Topics to be covered include uncertainty, inter-temporal choice, welfare, externalities, public goods and the problems of asymmetric information.  
  
The course textbook is [Varian's Intermediate Microeconomics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0393935337/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0393935337&linkCode=as2&tag=tholdenorg-21)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=tholdenorg-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0393935337).
