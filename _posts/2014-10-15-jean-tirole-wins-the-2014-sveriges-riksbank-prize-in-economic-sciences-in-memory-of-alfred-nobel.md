Tirole has made many huge contributions to the field of Industrial Organisation that we&#8217;re studying this semester. I know I&#8217;m a bit late on this as I&#8217;ve been away, but <a title="Jean Tirole's Nobel" href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/worthy-economics-nobel-jean-tirole" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a nice summary of why Tirole deserved to win the prize</a>.

We&#8217;ll be seeing some of his work later in the Industrial Organisation course, and this perhaps gives you an additional reason to consult <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0262200716/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0262200716&linkCode=as2&tag=tholdenorg-21" target="_blank">his excellent textbook</a>.

For more information, read this <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2014/popular-economicsciences2014.pdf" target="_blank">non-technical introduction to his work</a>, or this <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2014/advanced-economicsciences2014.pdf" target="_blank">more comprehensive one</a>.
