Tirole has made many huge contributions to the field of Industrial Organisation that we're studying this semester. I know I'm a bit late on this as I've been away, but [here's a nice summary of why Tirole deserved to win the prize](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/worthy-economics-nobel-jean-tirole).

We'll be seeing some of his work later in the Industrial Organisation course, and this perhaps gives you an additional reason to consult [his excellent textbook](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0262200716/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0262200716&linkCode=as2&tag=tholdenorg-21).

For more information, read this [non-technical introduction to his work](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2014/popular-economicsciences2014.pdf), or this [more comprehensive one](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2014/advanced-economicsciences2014.pdf).
