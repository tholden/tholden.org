This course is starting again, and the content of lectures will be a little different this year. But last year's slides might still be helpful, so I'm leaving them up here.  
  
The textbook for this year is:  


  * Oz Shy: “Industrial organization: Theory and applications” 338.6 SHY
  * “Goldilocks” level difficulty (I hope).
  * [Google shopping search. ](https://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?q=Oz+Shy:+%E2%80%9CIndustrial+organization:+Theory+and+applications%E2%80%9D&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&gbv=2&prmd=imvnso&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&biw=2133&bih=1183&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=14792013061029424712&sa=X&ei=yv9tUOPnCOvs0gWQ14DACg&ved=0CEMQgggwAA#scoring=tps)
  
Alternative texts:  


  * Jean Tirole, “The Theory of Industrial Organization” 338.6 TIR
  * A little difficult in places.
* Jeffrey Church and Roger Ware, “Industrial Organisation: A strategic Approach"

  * Not quite right for our course, but it is available for free at: [http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=jeffrey_church](http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=jeffrey_church)
Hope you enjoy the course.
