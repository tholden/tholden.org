This week we look more at product differentiation, covering  


  * Price discrimination in the Hotelling (1929) set-up. 
  * The Salop (1979) circular-city model, and how product proliferation may be used for entry deterrence.
  * The Shaked and Sutton (1982) quality choice model of vertical differentiation.
  * Some empirics, and other issues.
